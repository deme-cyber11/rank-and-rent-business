When you're desperate, you take bad terms. Plan ahead.

Different lenders = different products = different fits.

❌ **Mistake #3:** Not understanding the true cost
That "low rate" might have fees that make it expensive.

❌ **Mistake #4:** Using short-term money for long-term needs
MCAs for equipment? That math rarely works.

❌ **Mistake #5:** Letting pride stop you from asking questions
Every question you don't ask is money potentially left on the table.

      body: `**MARKET UPDATE**

SBA loan rates have stabilized this month after Q3 fluctuations. Current prime rate sits at [X]%, making 7(a) loans particularly attractive for businesses with strong cash flow.

**FUNDING SPOTLIGHT**

This week's success story: A manufacturing company secured $850K in equipment financing after being declined by three traditional banks. The key? Finding a lender who specialized in their specific equipment type.

**EDUCATION CORNER: Understanding Amortization**

Amortization isn't just a fancy word - it determines how much of each payment goes to principal vs. interest.

Early payments: Mostly interest
Later payments: Mostly principal

This matters because: If you're planning to refinance or pay off early, understanding amortization affects your total cost.

**QUICK TIP**

Always ask lenders for an amortization schedule before signing. Compare how much you'll pay in interest over the life of different loan options.

**THIS WEEK'S Q&A**

Q: "How long should I be in business before applying for an SBA loan?"

A: While SBA doesn't have a strict minimum, most lenders prefer 2+ years. However, startups with strong business plans, owner experience, and collateral can sometimes qualify through SBA programs specifically designed for newer businesses.`,
