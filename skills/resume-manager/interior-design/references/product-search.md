## Search Tips

1. **Start specific, then broaden**: If "japandi walnut console table" returns nothing, try "modern walnut console" or "minimalist entryway table"

2. **Use retailer-specific searches**: Add site name for curated results
   - "west elm arc floor lamp"
   - "cb2 marble coffee table"

3. **Include price anchors when given a budget**:
   - "modern sofa under $1500"
   - "affordable velvet accent chair"

4. **Search for dupes**: For expensive designer pieces, search "[designer piece name] dupe" or "look for less"

5. **Verify availability**: Always click through to confirm the product is in stock and the price is current

## Product Information to Capture

For each product, record:
- **Full product name** (as listed on site)
- **Direct URL** (not search results page)
- **Current price** (note if on sale)
- **Key specs** (dimensions, materials if relevant)
- **Ship time** (if notably long, mention it)

## Common Issues

**Product discontinued**: Search for "[product name] alternative" or describe the key features in a new search

**Price significantly changed**: Note the new price, offer an alternative if budget is a concern

**Out of stock**: Check if back-in-stock date is listed, or find a similar alternative

**Retailer doesn't ship to user's location**: Ask about location early, or note shipping limitations
